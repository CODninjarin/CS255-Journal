    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
        This project involved creating design documentation for the client. The clients goal was to create a cloud based site that allows users to create an                  account, purchase a package and utilize their driving and test practices. They are seeking to improve the skills of new drivers due to the lack of such               training in their area. The system has roles set in place for security as well as accounts for keeping track of user information. 
        
    What did you do particularly well?
        I think I did well in defining the functional and nonfunctional requirments. I included things the client asked for as well as thinking about additional              needs that could arise with this type of system.
        
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
        Within the System design documentations I included a class diagram that stated most attributes as private. This was an error on my part in the way I was              thinking the system would interact. These attributes should be private with getters and setters for data validation purposes.
        
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
        The site will be used by different types of users, such as Customers, employees, Admins, etc., and within the Business Requirement document there are points          that look into the needs of all users and some points that are more user type specific, such as different UI for employees and customers. I also included             within the limitations that users may need training to use the system, depending on the users need. 
        
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
        The main thing with designing software is to break down the needs of the client. There are multiple ways to design a system, but you need to ensure that              this includes what the client is asking for. Within this project there were a few key things the client directly asked for: a cloud based system, they laid           out how the UI should look, they gave the necessary security roles within the system and what they should be able to access, and they established the need            to be able to download and view data offline. A designer takes these things and designs the project around them.
        I think the process of interviewing a client and then finding the necessary parts of the project is a good strategy for started a project and making sure it's
        focused.
